# avro-patches

This gem contains patches to the official [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/)
Ruby gem v1.8.2.

We have attempted to follow the coding conventions used in the official `avro`
repo.

The following pending or unreleased changes are included:
- [AVRO-1886: Add validation messages](https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/111)
- [AVRO-1695: Ruby support for logical types revisited](https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/116)
- [AVRO-1969: Add schema compatibility checker for Ruby](https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/170)

In addition, compatibility with Ruby 2.4 (https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/191)
has been integrated with the changes above.

The following Ruby changes are not included, but could be added in the future:
- [AVRO-2001: Adding support for doc attribute](https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/197)
- [AVRO-1873: Add CRC32 checksum to Snappy-compressed blocks](https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/121)
